## :books: This repository contains everything you need to know about the Launch School book club! :books: :tada:

The Launch School Book Club is a place for LS students to come together and talk about books! We meet weekly on Wednesdays, 3pm CST. In addition to discussions surrounding the current book we are reading, this is a place to socialize and talk about any books we are reading or are interested in reading in the future. All students in Launch School are welcome to join anytime! :tada:
