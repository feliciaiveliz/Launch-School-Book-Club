## :books: This repository contains everything you need to know about the Launch School book club! :books: :tada:

The *Launch School Book Club* is a place for LS students to come together and talk about books! We meet weekly on **Wednesdays, 3pm CST/4pm EST**. In addition to discussions surrounding the current book we are reading, this is a place where we can socialize and talk about any books we are reading or are interested in reading in the future. All students enrolled in Launch School are welcome to join anytime! :tada:
