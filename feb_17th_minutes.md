## Summary of Meeting:

Our first meeting was held on February 17th at 4pm EST. It was lots of fun meeting new students and talking about books! We discussed how we wanted to organize our book club, from how often to meet to how to choose the books we will read. We have decided to use the `#books` Slack channel to communicate. So far, we have decided that we will read <insert # of chapters> a week to prepare for the next meeting. Jenae used this system to calculate the totals for which books are 1st, 2nd and 3rd place:

- 3 points for every '1' reaction
- 2 points for every '2' reaction
- 1 point for every '3' reaction
